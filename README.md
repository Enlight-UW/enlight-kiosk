enlight-kiosk
=============

The Enlight Kiosk is the publicly-accessible front-end to the fountain API. The physical Kiosk is located inside Engineering Hall, and runs this software - served by a browser navigated to the local page in fullscreen/kiosk mode.

With the Kiosk, users can manually engage the fountain jets. This overrides the default patterns temporarily - they are restored after an inactivity timeout.
